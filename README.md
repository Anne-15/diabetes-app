# Diabetes Monitoring and Management Platfor

A new Flutter project.

## Introduction

This project is a mobile flutter application that is geared towards aiding diabetic patients to navigate life
with the help of their specialists.

The app focuses on two main things:
- Mental health of the patients. It can be stressful knowing you have diabetes and don't know what to do and who to talk to.
- Open communication with a doctor or a specialist for advice or anything really to help with stigma around such events.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
